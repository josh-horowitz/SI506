No one knows how this ends. Some analysts say the intense activity could eventually prompt a wider
sell-off in the market by forcing hedge funds on the losing side of these trades to sell parts of
their portfolios to raise cash to cover their losses. While this speculative frenzy played out on
the marketâ€™s sidelines, the S&P 500 fell more than 2.5 percent on Wednesday, its worst day since
late October, as the Federal Reserve gave a glum assessment of the economy and before a number of
big tech companies announced their earnings.
